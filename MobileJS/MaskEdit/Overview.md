# Overview

The Essential JavaScript Mobile MaskEdit control provides an easy and reliable way of collecting your input and displaying standard data in a specific format. Some common uses of the MaskEdit control are IP address editors, phone number editors, and Social Security number editors. 

Key Features

Mask - The format where the value should be entered in the Textbox is set by using this property.

Watermark Text - The MaskEdit Textbox supports watermarking. A watermark is background text that appears in the Textbox without interfering with your text entry or the readability of the text entered. It can be used to display a ready instruction or other important information. It appears automatically before the text is entered and disappears once you enter the text.
