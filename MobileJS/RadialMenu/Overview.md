# Overview

Essential JavaScript Mobile Radial Menu control is a context that represent the menu items in a circular order with a center button element in it. By default, only the center button is visible. The Radial Menu displays the root level menu item with rotational animation effects on clicking the center menu button. You can close it either by clicking on document or by clicking on the center button when the root level items are displayed.

_Note: As per guidelines, the radial menu is displayed partially for an elegant look and feel but the control renders as a circular element only. Hence for Mobile (both phone and tablet mode) your Radial Menu control appears as semi-circular element, except in Windows mode where it is displayed as a circular element._

Key Features

* Nested Menu: Support to render child menu item.
